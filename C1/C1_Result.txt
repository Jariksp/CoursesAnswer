Complete 8 sub tasks to finish 1 complex task. Following time: 4 hours. 

1 Complex task:
Create (minimal viable product) game, where user can move some 3d rectangle with 1x1x2 size thought 2d map.
Minimal map size 4 cells. For user available 4 action: MoveLeft, MoveRight, MoveForward, MoveBack. 3D rectangle moving apply with him falling/upping to/from cells.
See gamplay [https://www.cokogames.com/box-run-3d-escape/play/](here). 

9 Sub task:
[5/5] 1. Write struct TMapPoint with: x, y coords. Write struct TSize with: x, y and z. Each coordinate should be integer type.
[5/5] 2. Write class T3DRectangleObject with method declarations: ActiveSide - return curren used side of NNActiveSide (exists two side: big and small), 
BaseCell - return base TMapPoint (using for finding occupied area by active side), 
OffsetsByActiveSide - return offsets with vector<TMapPoint> type for specify side using BaseCell for coordination, OccupiedArea - return vector<TMapPoint> type which descripe all used cells with specify
BaseCell and OffsetsByActiveSide. 

[10/10] 3. Integrate TSize to T3DRectangleObject with matching size (x, y, z) = (1, 1, 2). Use static variables to prevent magic variables.
Add to T3DRectangleObject method declarations: Size - return TSize, SizeToOffsets - return vector<TMapPoint> type with offests cells, by specify size and active side. 

[10/9.5] 4. Write class TBoxRun3DEscapeGame with method declarations: CreateGame - take vector<TMapPoint> type. which describe cells of map, and take Rectsngle BasePosition, 
IsDone - return true for game over state, Turns - return integer number, which describe lefts move actions, Step - take specify NNMoveAction: Left, Right, Forward, Back, 
Score - return integer value, which matches to bonuses points taken at map, Map - return map cells forwarded to CreateGame, Box - return T3DRectangleObject, Reset - will reset game state core. 

[10/10] 5. Implement functions from 2 task.
[15/13] 6. Implement functions from 3 task.
[30/28] 7. Implement functions from 4 task. 

[15/5] 8. Write autotest for 4 moving actions.
