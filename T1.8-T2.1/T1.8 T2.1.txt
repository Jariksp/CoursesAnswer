1. Create struct TSaveInfo, which take date info with specify format: dd:mm:yyyy. Use char* for holding info (as saving object). Create TSaveManager, which consists of TSaveInfo objects.

2. Select better implementation for TSaveManager API, where user can forward/extract saving data (using TSaveInfo) into TSaveManager, get container data, sort and map it by specify algorithm (using std::function as algorithm object).

3. Create several saves using TSaveManager. Sort holding objects by months, with descent order. Map holding objects by odd days.

During code writing use base (generic) lambda, std::string, shared_ptr and etc.
